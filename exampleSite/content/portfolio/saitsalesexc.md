We were given some sales data during the course and asked to create some simple visualisations. 

**ETL**
The source data did not requrie any cleaning as it was intended to be an exercise in creating visuals.

**Visualisation**
The data was then imported into Power BI where the dashbaord was built to highlight some information that management might find interesting vis-a-vis sales data.

The interactive report can be viewed at [this link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTJmNTBlMWEtNDU2Yi00MGZiLThkZjQtZTFhZDBkNGNjMGNjIiwidCI6ImY1MmYyMTgzLTlmNjctNGFkMi1iNjU2LTZmNzU0ZmUxOTZjYiIsImMiOjZ9).
