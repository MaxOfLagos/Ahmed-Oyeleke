## Interactive Dashboard
This dashboard includes features that prevent me from being able to embed it publicly such as Row-Level Security and the Q&A feature for data exploration (These are Microsoft Limitations). When the dashboard is completed, I will record a video of the various compenents and features and embed the video here. Interested parties can visit [this link]() to see more details about the project such as the charter, plan, goals and objectives, as well as details of the requirement gathering process.
